Hi there. I'm an applied AI researcher. I love to learn new AI algorithms and implement them. Some of the code snippets here are not original and were adapted from various online resources.

### Generative AI models implementations
1. [Deep Convolutional GAN](https://github.com/vishwa-explore/DC-GAN)
2. [Variational Auto Encoder (VAE)]()
3. [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)]()

### Large Language Models/ Natural Language Processing
1. [Finetuning LLM]()
2. [Transfomer]()
3. [Attention]()

### Computer Vision
1. [Convolutional Neural Net]()

### Multimodal Models
1. [Transformer]()
